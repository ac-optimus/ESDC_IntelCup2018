# Note
main.py is modification of Intel Movidus NCS example code. The weight file **.caffemodel** and model **.prototxt** files are converted **graph**, the file formate supported by Movidus  
**Intel Movidus NCS is not compatible with all the caffe and tensorflow models. It has its own layer requirement that has to be 
fulfilled to run inference on it.**
